## Hi there, nice to meet you 👋 

I'm Serena (she/her)—a software Engineer, currently working at Lloyds Banking Group.
I'm passionate about learning, working on new ideas while trying to make them look pretty too, as I've always been interested in all things design.

<b>Note: My work commits are hidden behin a Github Entreprise work account - so this space only reflects the projects I've been able to complete on my spare time.</b>
